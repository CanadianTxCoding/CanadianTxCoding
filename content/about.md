# What even is this thing?

The Canadian Coding Club is dedicated to having fun, while learning about computers, and programming. 

## __*We are do-ers. We solve problems.*__

Our motto is "do, don't think". It's alway better to do something rather than to ponder apon it. 

We use our skills with computers to *do*. We create projects to learn, to experiment, and better ourselves in our craft.
