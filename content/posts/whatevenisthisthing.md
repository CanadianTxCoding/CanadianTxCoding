About 3 months ago, I was sitting in a meeting about going into high school. It was just an overview of credits, how GPA works, how to get a program of study, blah blah blah. 

My grandma came with me, and while we were bored out of our minds at the mundanity of talking about how to get a diploma, we were looking through some papers.

We were given a packet full of papers that contained jobs, said jobs description, the median wage, ways to get involved with the job, etc. We were looking at computer scientist jobs, and it said the following:

* Join a club
* Learn programming
* Make projects

My Grandma looked at the first one and said "Huh, sucks that we dont have one around here".

For context, Canadian is a 3000 person, 1 stop light, town.

And then my Grandma said, half-joking, half-serious: "Hah, make your own." Thanks Grandma.

A few months later we started having meetings, where we code, some learn, some make projects, and its all good fun.

The entire point of this is to learn, in a place where we dont have many resources. In a 3000 person town, coding is a rare hobby, so us programmers have to stick together here.
